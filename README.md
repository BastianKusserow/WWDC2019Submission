# WWDC 2019 Submission
This is my WWDC 2019 submission.

## What is this about? 🤔
This playground is a game for learning math. Try to solve the calculations on the balloons and write the result on the canvas before they reach the bottom. If you're right, the mighty wizard will let them disappear 🧙🏽‍
What's your high score on this? 🙈

## Used technologies
For image prediction an image classifier is used. With Vision and CoreML a prediction of the drawn digit is made. SpriteKit is used for the game itself.
